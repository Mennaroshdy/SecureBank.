# 🏦 SecureBank Network Project

A simulation of a secure and scalable network infrastructure designed for a modern digital bank using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## 🔐 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust IT infrastructure for a bank, focusing on **network security**, **reliability**, and **inter-departmental communication**.

## 🧩 Key Features & Technologies

- 🔐 **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)** to control access to network resources.
- 🔄 **Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)** using Cisco ASA to secure inter-zone traffic.
- 🌐 **DMZ Architecture** for securely hosting public-facing services (Web, DNS, Mail).
- 🔗 **IPsec VPN (Site-to-Site)** to securely connect multiple branches or departments.
- 🧠 **Encrypted Passwords** and security best practices for device access control.
- 🧱 Network segmentation by departments (IT, Finance, HR, Engineering, Management).
- 📡 Use of dynamic routing protocols and VLANs for optimized traffic flow.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- ASA Firewall Simulator
- Network Protocols (IP, RIP, EIGRP, etc.)
- IPsec VPN Configuration

## ✅ Objective Achieved

The entire infrastructure was successfully implemented and tested virtually, ensuring secure communication, segmented zones, and proper access policies across all departments.
